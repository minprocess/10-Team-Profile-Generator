# 10-Team-Profile-Generator
## Description
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
## Table of Contents (Optional)
If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)
## Installation
The .gitignore file should have at least node_modules in it because Inquirer and Jest modules will be kept in the folder 'node_modules'.
Inquirer and Jest packages need to be installed. At the prompt of a Bash shell type these commands
npm init -y
npm i inquirer
npm i -D jest

## Usage
The lib folder contains 4 class definition files. The Manager, Engineer and Intern classes inherit from the Employee test. These classes are used in index.js and have corresponding test files in the folder __tests__. Jest is used to test those classes.
The team profile is created from the answers to questions asked by the Inquirer package in index.js. To create the team profile web page
node index
The file team.html is output to the folder 'dist'.
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
## Credits

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
## License
The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.
## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
## Features
If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
## How to Contribute
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
## Tests
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
